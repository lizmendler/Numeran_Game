# Implementing a Random Guessing Game

## My goal is to create a random number guessing game which I will be naming Numeran

Numeran will be a game which starts with the computer choosing a number between 1-100 which the user will then attempt to guess. Each time a guess is submitted, the computer will tell the user whether they are too high, too low or correct. If they are too high or too low, they will get the opportunity to try again. There will be a total of three tries that the user can attempt before they will then be shown a game over sign and will need to start again.

Users inputs will need to be between 1-100 and they cannot input the same number twice, if they input the same number they will be given a message letting them know they cannot guess the same number twice. The computer will need to check for valid inputs, which means they will check for non-numeric inputs and whether the guess is within the 1-100 range.

Once the user has completed their three tries, they will be shown the correct number and there will be a button below that automatically restarts the game with a new randomly generated number.
